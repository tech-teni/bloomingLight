            <h1 class="mb-5">The History and Ethos of Blooming Lights</h1>
          </div>
          <p>
            Blooming Lights is a vision of Olufunmilola. dz Olota, made possible by God with the support of her husband, Ademola Olota. The school was founded in September 2006 at Herbert Macauley (formerly Little Lights Montessori School).           </p>
          <p>
            It was shut down after a year and officially started all over again in Omole Phase 1, Ojodu Berger, on the 10th of September 2007. The name changed in 2008 from Little Lights Montessori to Blooming Lights Montessori School.
 </p>
            <p>It caters to children aged 3 months to 16 or 17 years. Here in Blooming Lights, pupils, teachers, and parents work and learn together. The school originally started with Creche and Nursery. The elementary department was opened in September 2009. As part of the 15th anniversary of the opening of the school in Omole phase one, which was held on the 10th of September 2022, Blooming Lights College (the secondary school arm) kicked off activities in September 2022 with J.S.S.1 and J.S.S.2 for continuity and stability in the education of our pupils.

              History

            <h1 class="mb-5">Welcome To Blooming Lights</h1>
          </div>
          <p>
            a whole new kind of love into your life, and you can’t imagine life without them. </p>
          <p>
            Here in Blooming Lights, we pay close attention to the method of instruction. We know children are unique individuals with different intelligences, we therefore put into consideration their interests and intelligences in order to plan for all our programs. We make use of 21st century teaching tools to ensure we give our children fun experiences in school.      </p>
            <p>Education is a shared commitment between dedicated teachers and staff, motivated pupils and enthusiastic parents with high expectations.
                Education today is not only to pursue academic excellence but also to motivate and empower pupils to be lifelong learners, detailed and critical thinkers who are productive members of an ever-changing global society.
                School is fun when the approach or method of instruction and interaction is child centred and focused on helping children unfold through self- discovery, explanation and experimentation. We provide an atmosphere where our children are encouraged to channel their potentials in pursuit of excellence.
                It is important to us to identify and nurture the talents, skills and abilities of each child and encourage them to reach great heights as we provide a platform to enable them think, express, and exhibit their skills.
                The method of instruction in BLM will empower them to negotiate several issues that confront them, with the teacher being the facilitator to guide them on the journey of discovery.

           <p>It is important to us to inculcate good values in the children, combined with academic and extracurricular activities that will enable them to become independent and self-reliant citizens of the school and the world at large. As we guide our pupils through the different stages of their learning and development, it is important for us to prepare them for life and groom them to face the challenges of tomorrow. Parents have a major role in molding the future of their children. Your support and contribution to different aspects of school life will empower us to put our best foot forward always.</p>
           <p>Education is not only about facts, but should also teach children how to think and learn on their own. Education is the key to the future as it will help discipline and prepare children for the challenges of the rest of the 21st century. Our role as a school in the proper schooling of a child’s mind cannot be over-emphasized. The role of parents in the overall development and success of children can equally not be overemphasized. With effective and healthy collaboration between home and school, we are certain that at the end of your child’s journey with BLM, we will, with confidence and a sense of pride, send forth your child to the next level of development with pride. With our dedicated team members, we are poised to guide you and your child on this interesting journey.</p>
           <p>The word of GOD says, “Train a child in the path he should go and when he grows, he will not depart from it” Proverbs 22:6. Giving children the right tools to kick off properly in life is our best investment that gives eternal peace. Children are a heritage of the LORD; the fruit of the womb is a reward. Ps. 127:3 Dennis Waitley said, "The greatest gifts you can give your children are the roots of responsibility and the wings of independence.” Kindly rest assured that your child is in an environment right for growth in every sense of the word.</p>
